    "### TO DO:\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome—this is a perfect moment to set the foundation so “add another config” is mostly wiring, not new code. Here’s a clear, reusable approach that fits your “main + plugins” shape and scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Normalize the data model\n",
    "- One application config file on disk:\n",
    "  main:\n",
    "    log_level: WARNING\n",
    "    screen_mode: \"1\"\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  plugins:\n",
    "    - id: clock1\n",
    "      type: clock\n",
    "      enabled: true\n",
    "      refresh: 30\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    - id: weather_sf\n",
    "      type: weather\n",
    "      enabled: true\n",
    "      units: metric\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "- Every plugin instance has:\n",
    "  - a stable id (string, unique)\n",
    "  - a type (plugin kind)\n",
    "  - its own key/values per its plugin schema\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Make schemas composable and discoverable\n",
    "- Keep one application schema with two top-level sections:\n",
    "  - main (flat field rules)\n",
    "  - plugins (rules for per-instance “envelope”: id, type, enabled, plus a schema_provider token to pull per-plugin rules)\n",
    "- Each plugin type provides its own schema (e.g., ${PLUGIN_SCHEMA:clock}).\n",
    "- Your existing token expansion registry can support parameterized tokens:\n",
    "  - ${DISPLAY_TYPES} (already)\n",
    "  - ${PLUGIN_SCHEMA:clock} → returns the field rules for a clock plugin\n",
    "- Providers live in paperpi/providers/… (e.g., get_plugin_schema(name)) and the daemon registers them at startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Design a generic daemon API\n",
    "Keep it resource-oriented and reusable. These 6 endpoints cover everything:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas\n",
    "- GET /schema/app → expanded, effective app schema (with main and plugins sections resolved)\n",
    "- GET /schema/plugin/{type} → expanded schema for a plugin type (resolver uses providers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Config read/write\n",
    "- GET /config/app → returns { main: {...}, plugins: [...] }\n",
    "- POST /config/check/app → { config } → { problems, submitted } (validate entire app config)\n",
    "- POST /config/write/app → { config } → { written, diff, message }\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugin instance management (optional, but pays off)\n",
    "- POST /config/plugin/{id}/check → { config } → validate just that instance (daemon looks up type → schema)\n",
    "- POST /config/plugin/{id}/write → write only that instance back into plugins[] (deep-merge by id)\n",
    "- POST /config/plugin → { id, type, config } add new instance\n",
    "- DELETE /config/plugin/{id} → remove instance\n",
    "- POST /config/plugin/{id}/reorder → move instance up/down (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the daemon always validates on the effective schema (tokens already expanded once at startup as you prefer).\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Web layer: one generic UI for any section\n",
    "- Keep one config.html template and move the input widgets into a Jinja macro: _field.html::render_field(key, value, rules, result)\n",
    "- Build two renderers in the route:\n",
    "  - For main: iterate key/value pairs from config[\"main\"]\n",
    "  - For plugins: iterate the list; for each instance, fetch the plugin’s effective schema (/schema/plugin/{type}) and render fields using the macro\n",
    "- Keep the existing schema-aware coercion (coerce_by_schema) and apply it:\n",
    "  - To main fields using app_schema[\"main\"]\n",
    "  - To each plugin instance using the per-plugin schema returned\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Validation flow (generic, section-aware)\n",
    "- On Check:\n",
    "  1) Load app_schema (and per-plugin schemas on demand)\n",
    "  2) Coerce submitted values per schema(s)\n",
    "  3) POST to POST /config/check/app\n",
    "  4) Show problems inline; compute changed (vs current) to enable the write button\n",
    "- On Write:\n",
    "  - Post the already-coerced, already-validated payload forward (payload_json) to POST /config/write/app\n",
    "  - Don’t re-fetch schema, don’t re-validate\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Reusable utilities (you already have many)\n",
    "- coerce_by_schema(values, schema) → works for both main and plugin instance dicts\n",
    "- update_yaml_file(path, changes) → write-by-diff\n",
    "- diff_configs(old, new) → shallow compare (extend to nested for plugins if you want finer “changed” detection)\n",
    "- Token expansion registry → now add a parameterized provider PLUGIN_SCHEMA:<type>\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Keep back-compat while migrating\n",
    "- Alias current routes:\n",
    "  - GET /config → GET /config/app\n",
    "  - POST /config/check_app → POST /config/check/app\n",
    "  - POST /config/write_app → POST /config/write/app\n",
    "- Update the template form action/formaction to the new endpoints when you’re ready\n",
    "\n",
    "8) UX suggestions (small but helpful)\n",
    "- After a successful Check (no problems), display a compact list of what changed (e.g., “3 fields changed: log_level, refresh_interval, splash”).\n",
    "- In plugins list, show per-instance headers like “Clock (id=clock1)” with enable/disable and a “Remove” button (wired later).\n",
    "- “Add plugin” flow:\n",
    "  - Choose type → daemon returns default config from GET /schema/plugin/{type} (or a token-provided default) → append to list with a temp id until written.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) A minimal step-by-step to get there\n",
    "1) Daemon\n",
    "   - Add /schema/app and /schema/plugin/{type} that return effective schemas (expanded once).\n",
    "   - Add /config/check/app and /config/write/app (you already have check+write split; just generalize names).\n",
    "2) Web\n",
    "   - Introduce GET /config/app (keep GET /config as alias).\n",
    "   - Switch your existing POST handlers to {name} forms (/config/check/app, /config/write/app) and keep the alias routes temporarily.\n",
    "   - Move field rendering into a macro so you can reuse for plugins.\n",
    "3) Plugins UI\n",
    "   - Render the list of instances; for each, fetch plugin schema and render fields inside a \\<fieldset\\>.\n",
    "   - Submit the entire app payload in one shot (main + plugins), so the daemon validates atomically.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Why this works (reusability wins)\n",
    "- One template, one coercer, one validator, one writer → parameterized by name or plugin type.\n",
    "- New plugin type? Add a schema provider + template rendering piggybacks on the macro. No new routes.\n",
    "- New config section? Add to the registry + schema and the same UI/controller logic handles it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can turn just your current “app” routes into the {name} version first (keeping old paths working), and sketch the plugin rendering macro—then you’ll have a pattern to extend to other sections without duplicating code.\n",
